Notes:
Computer broke two days before assignment was due and I lost everything. I was able to build my linked list and queue, and almost get to the working solution but fell just short.

Direction  to start on linux:
Once in directory, "make all"
Then, for the name of the file you would like to run: "./<filename.exe>"
In this Case, "./Assignment4Driver.exe"
