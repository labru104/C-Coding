Notes:
Because we couldn't use arrays, I had it take a command line argument in the main function, otherwise I would have had to use an array in argv


Directions to start on linux:
Once in directory, "make all"
Then, for the name of the file you would like to run: "./<filename.exe>"
In this Case, "./Assignment1Driver.exe"
